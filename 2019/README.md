# Better Scientific Software Fellowship

------------------------------------------------------------

## Experience

I'm a research software engineer at Stanford University in the [Research Computing Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu/), and over the three years of my employment I've made significant contributions to novel software for container orchestration, registries, and software [[1](#containers)], published my work [[2](#publications)], along with driving community development and practices in open source projects [[3](#contributions)]. My devotion to the scientific community and improving scientific reproducibility is shown through my work. I have over 500 respositories, and am a member of 25 organizations on GitHub. I regularly write blog posts and have recorded small podcasts to introduce readers to software, or open source ideas. I tend to pursue ideas that are important, and don't give up on the effort until I'm convinced there is a better way.

I've been working to establish research software engineering at Stanford, and realized that I need to approach it from more of a business perspective than an academic one. I had previously thought that open source could provide a venue for learning and growth, but I've realized that open source can never provide the funding needed to support a long term solution. Thus, I'm taking action to dually grow awareness for the need for research software engineers, along with doing whatever it takes to make the role a reality. Along with developing guides and online content for education [[4](#learning)], 
in the last few months I've established [RSE Services](https://stanford-rc.github.io/rse-services/) and am creating official avenues for researchers to get support with software at Stanford. On my own and without advertisement, I've already successfully completed three contracts and started a third. I'm hoping to engage with users and departments directly at the start of next year.

I applied to be a BSSw Fellow for the 2019 year and was given a mention, and I was unable to attend the events due to a conflict. I'm applying again because the effort that I'm currently fighting for, establishing the validity and career track for a Research Software Engineer, is important enough to warrant more coverage. I used to think that I could solve many problems in the world of scientific software just by building it myself, but I've come to realize that the problem reflects a larger issue with policy that doesn't allow for hiring staff specialized to ensure quality and sustainability of research outputs.

## Proposed Work and Impact

As a fellow, I want to transform the start of an initiative for Research Software Engineers into an official call for change. This means that I will pursue policy so that "Research Software Engineer" (RSE) can be an official title with a dedicated career track and support for growth. I want to pave the way for other talented engineers to be incentivized to become RSEs, so that an individual passionate about research that doesn't want to be a researcher also has an option to remain working at an academic institution. Currently, these individuals are most incentivized to leave academia to pursue positions in industry that offer better salaries or potential for long term growth. Without a base of software experts, in that data and code is a key ingredient in science, the quality and reproducibility of science at the academic institution suffers.

I've seen several methods for trying to tackle scientific reproducibility, ranging from trying to create and enforce it on an individual level (I've been doing this for years) to creating training to give scientists another unreasonable requirement to learn on top of an already large set of responsibilities. The best solution, I believe, is to create a currently non-existent layer of software engineers across the university. If a researcher needs help with software, it should be easy to get. It should be automatically included in grant funding. Indeed, if we have policy set up that better guides a new researcher through the entire process of writing scripts, to running analyses, and doing it reproduciblity, the entire ecosystem will benefit.

Specifically, as a fellow I will host an "RSE Day" to bring together Research Computing, the Data Sciences Initiative at Stanford, interested students, and academic departments. We will seek out and bring together currently existing RSEs that might sit in labs or have non-traditional roles, and create excitement and express need. I will dually be establishing policy and structure for the position, with help from others in leadership that also feel strongly about it. From these efforts we can create enough support from faculty to push the administration to fully support the new policy and definitions. By the end of 2020 I'd like to have the setup of RSE Services completed, an official role created, and a plan in place to hire research software engineers with expertise to support each department. I will share and write about the entire journey to ensure that other universities can follow suite.

For the focus areas, I work on many of the BSSw bullets on a daily basis (software engineering, documentation, automated builds, version control and issues, refactoring, tooling), however this particular project is a topic that is much more challenging for me, because it involves people. For this work, collaboration is the most prominent focus area, and Funding Sources and Programs likely the most relevant subtopic.
