# About Me

I'm a research software engineer at Stanford University in Research Computing, and
my devotion and passion has been the development of tools and standards for
scientific research. Although my training is in biomedical informatics (PhD from
Stanford in 2016) I think constantly about data structures, standards, and
software for scientific research. I believe that fostering a culture of
fun, open source development can both drive scientific computing and maintenance
of quality tools, along with making the development experience more fun
for scientists and developers alike. Thus, I am doing everything in my power 
towards this goal. In the last two years I have both led and contributed 
to a large set of open source projects, including (but not limited to):

 - [Singularity](https://www.github.com/singularityware/singularity)
 - [The Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io)
 - [The Scientific Filesystem](https://sci-f.github.io)
 - [Pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io)

Much of my thinking and efforts to teach others how to practice reproducible 
research can be found on [my personal site](https://vsoch.github.io).

## Aspirations

I am currently a software engineer, a goal (and now reality) that I set after
completing a non-STEM colleage degree and realizing in a post-graduate
job as a research assistant that I loved programming. I have now realized that
the open source initiative, and training for reproducible research, needs to
be a core of graduate training, and that we need better understanding of
these practices. Toward this goal, I've started a collaboration
with the Institute for Software Research (Carnegie Mellon) with hopes of
creating a layer of missing software engineers in the traditional University
environment.

I have [vision for an open source lab](https://gist.github.com/vsoch/2e5be134449ec6ffb11887c03cc19a41) that I am pursuring for this next
stage of my career. This vision aims to bring open source software engineering 
into the education of scientists, and to provide a base to develop badly needed
tools for research that right now does not exist.

## How I heard about the fellowship

I don't actively seek out fellowships or opportunities to grow a resume, but
my supervisor sent this directly to me, and it really sounds like it fits me
to a T! I would love support to spread my vision, to share my excitement
for developing tools for science, and to find more friends (I mean, collaborators!)
that share this passion.

## Experience

In the last two years I have both led and contributed to a large set of open source projects, including (but not limited to):

### Singularity Containers

Singularity (https://www.github.com/singularityware/singularity) is an open source linux container technology that I was one of the primary contributors to for its first two years (before the company Sylabs was created and they now maintain it). I wrote the entirety of the first version's backend to communicate with registry APIs, and advocated for and then added many of the features that helped it to take off! I also played a softer role in adding a lot of fun into the project, and overlooked details like beautiful documentation to draw in users.

### Container Tools
Are an entire set of tools (https://singularityhub.github.io) that I am lead developer for, and likely many thing are under the Sylabs umbrella. This includes https://www.singularity-hub.org along with its open source Singularity Registry Server.

### The Experiment Factory
The Experiment Factory (https://expfactory.github.io) is software for the easy creation and deployment of reproducible experiment containers. I started this project as a graduate student when I noticed a colleague hard coding psychology web-based experiments into a folder. It's first version resulted in an invaluable tool for my lab (expfactory.org) that drove several publications. This closed version did not satisfy my
vision for a community tool, so the second version is better developed around that.

### The Scientific Filesystem
Containers traditionally have one entrypoint, and this is an issue because scientific software needs to be reproducible (meaning one container) but have several entrypoints (executables to run) each with metadata, environments, etc. The Scientific Filesystem  (https://sci-f.github.io) was my first published specification for this technology.

### Pydicom

Pydicom (https://pydicom.github.io) is a community I brought together noticing that there were several popular and important tools for medical imaging in Python, but nobody had made friends yet. I am lead developer for one of the tools (deid) to clean and parse dicom image pixels and headers.
